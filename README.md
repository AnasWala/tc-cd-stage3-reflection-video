## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my self-learning project and reflection video for the subject **Theory of Computation and Compiler Design (TC & CD)**.  
The focus of my study was on **Applications of Finite Automata in Text Search and Pattern Matching**, where I explored how core automata theory concepts are applied in real-world systems such as **search engines, compilers, and pattern recognition tools**.

The goal was to simplify the concept, demonstrate its practical importance, and present it in a short educational video.

## 🧠 Learning Summary

This video was created as part of the **Stage 2: Activity 2** and **Stage 3: Reflection** for the Self-Learning module.  
The learning journey involved:

- Selecting the topic based on its practical applications in compiler design and pattern matching.  
- Researching through **NPTEL lectures**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **Hopcroft & Ullman’s Automata Theory** book.  
- Preparing a detailed yet simplified **presentation and script**.  
- Recording the session using **OBS Studio**, and editing it with **Clipchamp**.  
- Publishing the final video and documenting the process on **GitHub**.

This project strengthened my understanding of how theoretical computation concepts connect with real-world software systems and improved my **communication, scripting, and presentation** skills.

## 💡 Reflection Summary

Through this self-learning task, I developed both **technical and professional** skills.  
I gained confidence in explaining theoretical concepts clearly, understood how **finite automata** support **text search algorithms** and **lexical analyzers**, and learned how to manage a project from research to final publication.  

This experience also helped me enhance my **self-learning mindset**, which will be valuable in **placements**, **research**, or **higher studies**.
